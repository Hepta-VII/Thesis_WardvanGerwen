# Thesis_WardvanGerwen

Within this Github I present the code and node details used for my Thesis: **Blockchain based data management system in an IoT environment.**

The goal of this PoC is to test near-instant low cost transactions on the LN while including an decryption key   
The decryption key belongs to a encrypted file stored on IPFS, whereby the participants shared this CID beforehand   
The LN is used to transfer the value.  

**Software used**.  
LightningPolar: https://lightningpolar.com  
Docker: https://www.docker.com  

**Node details**.  
3 Bitcoin core nodes  
10 Lightning LND Nodes  
8 Payment channels between those nodes   





## Basic architecture:
